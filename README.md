A job portal is an online platform built using a combination of HTML, CSS, PHP, 
and database technologies to facilitate the interaction between job seekers and employers. 
HTML and CSS are used to create the visual layout and design elements of the portal,-
ensuring an intuitive and user-friendly interface for navigating job listings and profiles.
PHP, a server-side scripting language, handles the dynamic aspects of the portal
such as user authentication, job search functionality, and data processing.
Behind the scenes, a database system such as MySQL stores and manages vast amounts of structured data,
including user profiles, job listings, and application records. Together, these technologies power the seamless operation of the job porta
, enabling efficient job search and recruitment processes for both individuals and organizations.
